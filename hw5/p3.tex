\section*{Algorithm}

Assume that the requests are grouped by the player making the request. Let us create an $n \times n$ adjacency matrix $A$ of integers representing our graph, and initialize all values in $A$ to 1. Iterate through the players and examine their requests as follows:\\ 
For player $i$, if player $i$ requests to be on the same team as player $j$, set $A(i, j) = 0$.\\
For player $i$, if player $i$ request to not be on the same team as player $j$, set $A(i, j) = \infty$.\\
Then, let us perform a modified version of DFS on that adjacency matrix. Starting with the first player, iterate through the players. Let $u$ be the current player.\\
\textbf{Case 1:} If $u$ is uncolored or pink, color $u$ pink. Iterate through all of the edges $uv$ going out of $u$, and all edges $vu$ coming into $u$ where $v$ is uncolored. If the weight of $uv$ or $vu$ is 0, color $v$ pink, and search all edges outgoing from $v$ in the same way, coloring the nodes red when the search from that node is complete. If the weight of $uv$ or $vu$ is $\infty$, color $v$ blue, and do not search further. If the weight of both $uv$ and $vu$ is 1, color $v$ grey, and keep searching out from $v$, coloring nodes grey along the way. If we are at a node $v$ that has an outgoing edge with weight infinity, if it is a back edge to a node colored grey or pink, color $v$ blue and stop the search there, coloring all previous nodes red.\\
\textbf{Case 2:} If $u$ is blue, iterate through all of the edges $uv$ going out of $u$, and all edges $vu$ coming into $u$. If the weight of $uv$ or $vu$ is 0, color $v$ blue, and search all neighbors of $v$. If the weight of $uv$ or $vu$ is $\infty$, color $v$ pink, and do not search $v$. If the weight of $uv$ or $vu$ is 1, do not search or color $v$.\\
\textbf{Case 3:} If $u$ is red, there is no need to search $u$ further.\\
